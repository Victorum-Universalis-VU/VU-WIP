#8025 - Stavelot

add_core = STV
culture = wallonian			#Verviers, Malmedy, and Stavelot seem reliably French majority -if heavily influenced by Germanic culture, from the start, and would be decidedly so at the first truly accurate census information. Note the eastern edge of this province would be germanic.
religion = catholic
capital = "Verviers"			#This is a problematic area. We have 2 major cities, Verviers and Malmedy, as well as 3 major border concerns, Liege-owned (Verviers), Brabantine-owned (Limburg), and the independent microstate of Malmedy-Stavelot. And that is just at start... forget the later Prussian, Belgian, and French borders, or the shifting cultural and religious borders. There is no good solution, but the compromise I'm going with is the largest city is the capital, but owner is the only one with no other provinces.
base_tax = 2
base_production = 3			#Verviers was just a small village until 1500s, exploded in 1500s and 1600s, by late 1700s it was one of the top 5 cities in Low Countries by wealth and importance. Note despite some serious economic weight, it never had a giant population like many urban cities in the Low Countries. Apparently only up to around 30k by our end date in 1830s, and under 10k in early 1700s.
base_manpower = 2
trade_goods = cloth			#Verviers was responsible for a staggering 73 percent of Liege's exports, overwhelming wool cloth, while Malmedy's main business was paper manufacturing as well as leather tanning. Could go either way... Not too many paper provs around, so that would be good, but this was such a major center of cloth that it would be remiss to ignore that.
